Chapter 6 - Project 3

Project 3: progressive enhancement art gallery Search 
DifficuLty LEvEL: Intermediate

Overview

You will build upon your existing HTML page designed in Chapter 4 Project 2, but replace the existing 
content with an enhanced version (progressive enhancement) where a small piece of JavaScript is added so 
that every image can be hovered on to see a larger thumbnail as needed.

1. Like the previous two projects, begin by adding a link to a JavaScript file in the head of your page 
(or right before the </body> tag).

2. Slightly modify the HTML to add a class for each thumbnail image.

3. In your JavaScript file, write a loop to seek out all the img tags with the newly
   defined class (hint: querySelectorAll()).

4. For each image, attach a listener on the mouseIn event to create a new <span>
  with a larger image inside (based on the src attribute). Add another listener on the mouseOut event 
  to hide the newly created <span>.
  
Test

1. Reload the page, and see that as you hover over images, larger quality thumbnails are fetched and 
seen in a <div> over the mouse location as shown in Figure 6.23.

2. As you move your mouse out the page should return to the way it was before you hovered.
